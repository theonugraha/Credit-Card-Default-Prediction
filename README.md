# Credit Card Default Prediction
---
## Project Background
I am a data scientist with a bank as a client. The client asked me to analyze and predict the possibility of credit card defaults from its customers. The client allows me to use any method as long as the results of my prediction can provide the highest accuracy value, so that the bank can quickly decide the possibility of default or not. As the material to build the model, I was given a credit card dataset from the bank.

## Objective
This project aims to predict credit card customer defaults with an algorithm that has the best accuracy rate.
